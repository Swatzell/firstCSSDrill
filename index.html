            <h2>How Music Works by David Byrne</h2>
            <p>How Music Works is David Byrne’s incisive and enthusiastic look at the musical art form, from its very
                inceptions to the influences that shape it, whether acoustical, economic, social or technological.</p>

            <h2>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream by Hunter S.
                Thompson</h2>
            <p>This cult classic of gonzo journalism is the best chronicle of drug-soaked, addle-brained, rollicking
                good times ever committed to the printed page. It is also the tale of a long weekend road trip that has
                gone down in the annals of American pop culture as one of the strangest journeys ever undertaken.</p>

            <h2>The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger</h2>
            <p>The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named
                Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves
                his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is
                at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the
                safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to
                beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it.</p>

            <h2>Survivor: A Novel by Chuck Palahniuk</h2>
            <p>Tender Branson—last surviving member of the Creedish Death Cult—is dictating his life story into the
                recorder of Flight 2039, cruising on autopilot at 39,000 feet somewhere over the Pacific Ocean. He is
                all alone in the airplane, which will crash shortly into the vast Australian outback. But before it
                does, Branson will unfold the tale of his journey from an obedient Creedish child and humble domestic
                servant to an ultra-buffed, steroid- and collagen-packed media messiah.</p>
